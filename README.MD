Artscape was inspired by an idea to provide users with an “artistic escape” through a hyper-personalized art gallery experience through the comfort of their screen. We strived towards centering Artscape around the user’s creativity and curiosity so they could explore the limits of the art they are currently observing and the art they would like to view in the future.
To use our application, first a user must sign in with a username and password and if they do not already have one, they may sign up. They will then be directed to our gallery view page where they are shown 6 images to choose from and an option to upload their own images. Whatever photo the user chooses is the photo that will be made into a mosaic. Once you hit submit be patient as the program may take a second. When the mosaic is generated the user will then be on our mosaic view page and they will have an interactive mosaic in front of them. The user can drag the black box around the image to zoom into the smaller images making up the mosaic. They may also click on whatever photo they like and press submit and the mosaic will be remade into a mosaic of the selected image.
